## Project Overview

The Walmart Loss Prevention AI System is a cutting-edge web application designed to enhance security and minimize inventory shrinkage in retail environments. Leveraging AI-powered real-time monitoring and predictive analytics, this system provides store management and security personnel with critical insights and alerts to prevent theft and optimize operational efficiency.

This project was developed as part of a Hackathon, demonstrating the rapid prototyping and potential of AI in practical loss prevention scenarios.

## Features

* **Dashboard:** Real-time overview of prevented loss, active alerts, camera status, and AI accuracy.
* **Live Monitoring:** View live camera feeds (simulated), observe AI detections, and receive instant theft alerts.
* **AI Analysis:** See a breakdown of AI activities like person tracking, object detection, and anomaly detection.
* **Security Alerts:** Comprehensive log of all generated alerts with details on activity, location, confidence, and severity.
* **Incident Reporting:** Manual reporting feature for unforeseen events or suspicious activities.
* **Interactive Store Map:** Visualize camera locations and risk levels within a simulated store layout.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Insights into potential loss reduction and system efficiency trends.
* **Responsive UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a modern and intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Deployment:** Vercel

## Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this project locally for development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ayushimondal/THEFT-MONITORING-SYSTEM.git](https://github.com/ayushimondal/THEFT-MONITORING-SYSTEM.git)
    cd THEFT-MONITORING-SYSTEM
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or a similar port).

## Deployment

This application is deployed using **Vercel** for seamless continuous integration and delivery.

* **Build Command:** `npm run build` (executed by Vercel)
* **Output Directory:** `dist/` (or `build/` depending on your Vite config, Vercel usually auto-detects)

The `npm run build` command generates the optimized static assets ready for production, which Vercel then serves globally.

## Future Enhancements

* Integration with actual CCTV systems.
* Advanced anomaly detection algorithms.
* User authentication and role-based access control.
* Historical data analysis and reporting.
* Mobile application integration.
